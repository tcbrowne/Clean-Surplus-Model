# Clean-Surplus-Model (Risidual Income Model)

Objective: use model to estimate the value of firm's shares then compare to actual market value

Theory supplied by Feltham and Ohlson (FO; 1995).

Model provides framework for determining market value by utilizing balance sheet and income statement fundamentals.

# Assumptions
Assumes capital market conditions are stable and dividend irrelevancy.

Assumes that ROE stays constant for horizon input. In reality, ROE can change in response to a number of factors such as competition. ROE has been determined from the fundamentals of the financial statements in one particular year. Therefore, it is static and may not encapsulate all the information gathered / researched, for instances, by analysts.

Additionally, model assumes that abnormal earnings persist for the horizon given and then drop to zero. Reality could be quite different, for example, persist for only three years or fifteen. There is potential for a 'declining abnormal earnings pattern' that is not captured in this model.

# Estimates and Variables
Highlevel: risk-free interest rate, dividend payout ratio, and cost of capital (CAPM).
